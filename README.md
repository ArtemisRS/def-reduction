Tool to sim how much BGS helps on warden p4. Hardcoded with my gear (see
commented out for example max). Not intended for use by anyone other than me,
but source may be useful?

Example output:
```bash
TTK with 0 BGS specs: 81.1205
  miss %: 100, TTK: 81.12050070000001
  % slower than 106.2679: 8
TTK with 1 BGS specs: 75.7078
  miss %: 35, TTK: 84.73427105338517
  % slower than 99.1772: 11
TTK with 2 BGS specs: 72.3933
  miss %: 12, TTK: 88.32395191960866
  % slower than 94.8352: 9
```
